# Reddit Account Warmup Playbook

## Overview
Brief intro explaining why warmup matters (anti-spam detection, CQS building).

## Quick Reference

| Tier | Days | Comments/Day | Posts/Day | Target Karma |
|------|------|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| New | 1-7 | 3 | 0 | 15 |
| Warming | 8-14 | 5 | 1 | 100 |
| Ready | 15-30 | 8 | 2 | 250 |
| Established | 30+ | 15 | 3 | 500 |

## Day-by-Day Schedule

### Days 1-7: Lurker Mode
- Goal: Build trust, establish cookies, verify email
- Session length: 15-20 minutes
- Actions:
  - Browse front page and subscribed subreddits
  - Upvote 5-10 posts (natural browsing)
  - Subscribe to 5-10 relevant subreddits
  - 0-3 short comments (casual, conversational)
  - NO posts, NO external links
- Email verification: MANDATORY by day 2

### Days 8-14: Light Engagement
- Goal: Build comment karma, establish posting history
- Session length: 20-30 minutes
- Actions:
  - Continue browsing patterns
  - 3-5 thoughtful comments
  - 1-2 text posts total across the week
  - NO external links still
- CQS check: Post to r/WhatismyCQS by day 10

### Days 15-30: Building Consistency
- Goal: Reach posting requirements for most subreddits
- Session length: 20-30 minutes
- Actions:
  - 5-8 comments per day
  - 2-4 posts per week
  - Can include internal Reddit links
  - Minimal external links (only when very relevant)

### Days 30+: Established
- Goal: Normal activity, can begin light promotion
- Actions:
  - 10-15 comments per day max
  - 3-5 posts per week
  - Follow 80/20 rule (8 non-promo : 1 promo max)

## Activity Guidelines

### What Makes a Good Comment
- Reply to existing discussions
- Add value (experience, insight, humor)
- 1-3 sentences typical
- NO copy-paste templates
- Match subreddit tone

### What to Avoid
- Rapid-fire posting (wait between comments)
- Same comment in multiple threads
- External links in first 2 weeks
- Self-promotion before day 30
- Posting immediately after account creation

## Subreddit Selection

### Good Starter Subreddits
- Large, active communities (>100k subscribers)
- Discussion-based (not just memes/images)
- Friendly to new users
- Examples: r/AskReddit, r/todayilearned, r/explainlikeimfive

### Subreddits to Avoid Initially
- Heavily moderated (r/science, r/history)
- Karma-gated (check sidebar requirements)
- Anti-spam sensitive (r/news, political subs)
- Your target promotional subreddits (save for later)

## CQS (Contributor Quality Score)

### What is CQS
Reddit's internal trust score. Affects post visibility and filtering.

### CQS Tiers
- Lowest: Heavy filtering, posts often invisible
- Low: Some filtering
- Moderate: Normal visibility (minimum target)
- High/Highest: Full visibility, trusted

### How to Check
Post "check" to r/WhatismyCQS (automated response)

### How to Improve
1. Verify email (Lowest -> Low immediately)
2. Diverse subreddit engagement
3. Positive upvote ratios on posts
4. Consistent activity over time
5. Avoid: Links in profile bio, spam reports

## Tracker Integration

The Dolphin tracker monitors warmup status:

- **warmup_tier**: Current tier (new/warming/ready/established)
- **limit_status**: OK/WARNING/EXCEEDED
- **comments_today**: Daily comment count
- **posts_today**: Daily post count

Alerts fire at 80% of daily limit to give time to pause.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Starting too fast**: Don't post on day 1
2. **Ignoring email verification**: Causes Lowest CQS
3. **Using consistent timing**: Vary session times
4. **Copy-paste comments**: Triggers spam filters
5. **Promotional links early**: Wait until day 30+

# Troubleshooting: Banned and Suspended Accounts

## Quick Diagnosis

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Section |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| "Account suspended" | TOS violation or spam | [Suspended](#suspended-accounts) |
| Profile shows 404 | Deleted or shadowbanned | [Not Found](#not-found-accounts) |
| Posts don't appear | Shadowban or low CQS | [Shadowban](#shadowban-detection) |
| Comments removed | Automod or spam filter | [Filtering](#content-filtering) |

## Suspended Accounts

### What Happened
Reddit suspended the account for TOS violation. This is permanent in most cases.

### Common Causes
1. Vote manipulation (upvoting own content from other accounts)
2. Ban evasion (creating account to bypass subreddit ban)
3. Spam (promotional content, repeated messages)
4. Multiple accounts on same IP without distinction
5. Automated behavior detection

### What to Check
- Was the account too active too fast? (check warmup tier vs activity)
- Were multiple accounts used on same proxy session?
- Was there any promotional content before day 30?
- Did the account participate in vote rings?

### Recovery
- Suspensions are usually permanent
- Appeal only if you believe it's an error (reddit.com/appeals)
- Mark profile as "suspended" in Dolphin notes
- Retire the proxy session (don't reuse on new account)

## Not Found Accounts

### What Happened
Account returns 404 - could be deleted, suspended, or shadowbanned.

### Diagnosis Steps
1. Visit reddit.com/u/{username} in browser
2. If "Sorry, nobody on Reddit goes by that name": Account deleted or never existed
3. If page loads but empty: Possible shadowban
4. If "suspended" message: Account suspended (see above)

### Common Causes
- Account deleted by user
- Account never created despite Dolphin profile existing
- Hard suspension (account completely removed)

### Recovery
- Check Dolphin notes - was account actually created?
- If notes say "need to create": Create the Reddit account
- If genuinely deleted: Retire the Dolphin profile

## Shadowban Detection

### What is a Shadowban
Account appears active to the owner but content is invisible to others.

### How to Check
1. Open incognito browser
2. Visit the account's profile: reddit.com/u/{username}
3. If 404 in incognito but works logged in: Shadowbanned
4. Post in r/ShadowBan for automated check

### Common Causes
- Spam behavior (even if not intentional)
- Posting same link multiple times
- Participating in vote manipulation
- Using datacenter/flagged IP addresses

### Recovery
- File appeal at reddit.com/appeals
- Explain situation briefly, be polite
- If approved, get confirmation email
- After recovery: Use different proxy, follow warmup strictly

## Content Filtering

### Symptoms
- Comments/posts don't appear publicly
- No upvotes or replies on content
- "Your post is awaiting approval" messages

### Causes
1. **Low CQS**: Posts filtered by Reddit's spam system
2. **Automod rules**: Subreddit-specific requirements not met
3. **Karma gates**: Subreddit requires minimum karma
4. **Account age gates**: Subreddit requires minimum age

### Diagnosis
1. Check CQS at r/WhatismyCQS
2. Read subreddit sidebar/rules
3. Check if content appears when logged out

### Solutions
1. **Low CQS**:
   - Verify email immediately
   - Remove links from profile bio
   - Build genuine engagement before promotional content

2. **Automod/karma gates**:
   - Check subreddit requirements
   - Build karma in other subreddits first
   - Wait for account age requirement

## Proxy-Related Bans

### Symptoms
- Multiple accounts banned around same time
- New accounts banned immediately
- "Suspicious activity" messages

### Common Causes
- Shared proxy session between accounts (Phase 1 audit issue)
- Datacenter IP detected
- IP range flagged for abuse
- Too many accounts on same residential IP

### Diagnosis
1. Run audit_profiles.py to check proxy configuration
2. Look for "shared_session" issues
3. Verify proxy is residential, not datacenter

### Solutions
1. Each account needs unique sticky session
2. Use residential proxies only
3. Spread accounts across different IP ranges
4. See PROXY_SETUP.md for configuration

## Prevention Checklist
